## Description

This project involved creating a simple scheduling interface that allows users to note workday "to-do's" and notate anything special about them to keep in mind.

- The motivation for creating this project was continuing to develop vanilla JavaScript skills while mixing in JQuery, Bootstrap, and moment.JS APIs in order to get a handle on the scope of what even a simple webpage uses.
- I built this project largely in order to continue to get practice with the skills we are working on in class. While much of the HTML was created for us in the starter code, I used Bootstrap in order to fill out the table and added some custom CSS (which we learned how to do this week) to overwrite aspects of the Bootstrapped elements that I wasn't entirely satisfied with. This project involved getting several different layers of JavaScript involved, including time documentation from moment.JS, JQuery, and browser local storage keys. The project's active result is a useful tool that allows a user to plan their work day by recording to-do's for the day and notes on any special steps they may want to take to complete the list item. There is a save button for each item that corresponds to the given row if the user would like to save that item in local storage to continue to later.
